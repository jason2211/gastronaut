#### Do you find yourself eating the same things you always eat? _Try something new, become a Gastronaut!_

<br/>

Gastronaut is a website to help you discover new and diverse restaurants in your area. Plan a mission, eat the food, plant a flag!

_Why Gastronaut?_

- Quickly see and search a wide swath of restaurant categories with additional filters available so you can find what you want when you want it.

- Come up with a great mission of restaurants to visit? Share it with the local area so other gastronauts can go on your mission too!

- Want to share your experience? Write a mission report and let the world know.

- Start a Gastronaut Group and share a mission with friends or family to invite them to join you as you complete your mission. Maybe you're going to visit all the restaurants and they can meet you when you go. Or maybe youâ€™ll just each visit or order food from the restaurants on the mission and have some gastronomical experiences to share.
