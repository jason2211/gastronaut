## _Restaurant Discovery and Food Exploration Website_

#### Do you find yourself eating the same things you always eat? Try something new, become a Gastronaut!

<br/>

Gastronaut is a website to help you discover new and diverse restaurants in your area. Find some gems, plan a mission, eat the food, plant a flag!

_Why Gastronaut?_

- Quickly see and search a wide swath of restaurant categories with additional filters available so you can find what you want when you want it.

- Come up with a great mission of restaurants to visit? Share it with the local area so other gastronauts can go on your mission too!

- Want to share your experience? Write a mission report and let the world know.

- Start a Gastronaut Group and share a mission with friends or family to invite them to join you as you complete your mission. Maybe your going to visit all the restaurants and they can join you, or maybe you will just each visit or order food from the restaurants and have the common gastronomical experiences to share.
